# Learning-Management-System-With-Laravel-Voyager
Using laravel voyager to crate a basic learning management system on laravel

This project is a learnnig management system designed on laravel voyager admin panel

It is mostly focused on the back-end functionalities, so it has a very basic front-end that you can modify however you want.

As reference i used this very good tutorial on youtube from "Laravel Daily" youtube channel, where he used another admin panel called "Laravel Quick Admin Panel"

Here is a link to the playlist of the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdXLsjL7A9k0NlUGL9M7ah9Fnvo3HybRl

Here are some Details:

  1.3 Migrations:
  
    BE CAREFUL with migrations.
    All migrations are created but laravel voyager also have its own migrations, so put yours in a different folder
    and call it from that path or folder.
    Try not to mess around voyager's tables or backup the database before refreshing for example.
    
  1.4 Seeders:
      
      The Courses created will all be synced to the admin (you can change that in the CoursesSeeder.php)
      Use The CoursesSeeder.php that i created to make:
      5 Courses, each have
      5 Lessons, each have
      1 Test, each have 
      5 Questions, each have
